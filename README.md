# PyWinUI
PyWinUI is a WinUI 3 wrapper for Python. Currently, it is being developed.


## A quick note:
PyWinUI is being actively developed. The source code isn't available yet, but once I throw together a basic version of PyWinUI, I'll release the source code as a public beta.

## Why this repository is archived:
This repository is archived because development is going slower, so I'll have to consider with some choices.
